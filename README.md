This is a simple Java-based song playlist application, where users can create playlists, add songs, and navigate through the playlist with a few simple commands. The application uses a LinkedList to maintain the playlist and allows the user to perform actions like adding, removing, and viewing songs.

The app is designed to mimic a music player, where each song has a title, duration, and is part of an album. The user can add songs to a playlist by their title or track number. The application supports various commands such as moving to the next or previous song, replaying the current song, and deleting songs from the playlist.

Users can also view all available songs and their corresponding albums, making it easy to browse and select the songs they want to add to their playlist. If the user wants to start a fresh session, they can restart the playlist and continue adding or playing songs.

The application is structured with two primary classes: Album and Song. The Album class holds song details, while the Song class contains information about the song itself.
